      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Bangladesh is making significant strides in its energy sector with the construction of the <strong>Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant (RNPP)</strong>, the country’s first nuclear power project. Located in Pabna district, about 160 km northwest of Dhaka, this mega-project is set to revolutionize Bangladesh’s power generation capacity, ensuring energy security and reducing reliance on fossil fuels.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>The Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant is being built with technical and financial support from <strong>Russia</strong>. The project includes two <strong>VVER-1200 reactors</strong>, each with a capacity of <strong>1,200 megawatts (MW)</strong>, totaling <strong>2,400 MW</strong> upon completion.</p>

      <h2>Key Features:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Technology:</strong> Advanced Russian VVER-1200 (Generation III+) reactors, known for enhanced safety features.</li>
        <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Estimated at <strong>$12.65 billion</strong>, financed largely through a Russian loan.</li>
        <li><strong>Timeline:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Unit 1:</strong> Expected to be operational by <strong>2024</strong> (delayed, likely 2025).</li>
            <li><strong>Unit 2:</strong> Scheduled for completion in <strong>2025</strong> (possibly 2026).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why Nuclear Power for Bangladesh?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Energy Demand:</strong> Bangladesh’s growing economy requires a stable and large-scale power supply.</li>
        <li><strong>Clean Energy:</strong> Nuclear power emits minimal greenhouse gases, supporting climate goals.</li>
        <li><strong>Fuel Efficiency:</strong> A small amount of uranium can produce massive energy compared to coal or gas.</li>
        <li><strong>Energy Security:</strong> Reduces dependence on imported fossil fuels.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Safety and Environmental Concerns</h2>
      <p>The Rooppur plant incorporates <strong>multiple safety systems</strong>, including passive cooling and containment structures to prevent accidents. The <strong>International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)</strong> has reviewed the project, ensuring compliance with global standards. However, some environmental groups remain cautious about nuclear waste management and potential risks.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Economic and Employment Impact</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Thousands of jobs have been created during construction.</li>
        <li>Local industries and infrastructure are benefiting from the project.</li>
        <li>Long-term energy affordability is expected once operational.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>High initial costs and loan repayment.</li>
        <li>Need for skilled manpower and technical training.</li>
        <li>Public awareness about nuclear safety.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant marks a historic step in Bangladesh’s energy independence. Once completed, it will supply about <strong>10% of the country’s electricity</strong>, paving the way for sustainable development. With proper management and safety protocols, RNPP could be a game-changer for Bangladesh’s energy future.</p>
