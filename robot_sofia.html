    <h1>Meet Robot Sophia: The World's First Humanoid Citizen</h1></div>
    <div class="ai-paragraph ">

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made tremendous advancements in recent years, and one of the most fascinating outcomes of this progress is <strong>Robot Sophia</strong>. Created to resemble a human both in appearance and behavior, Sophia is not just a machine — she is a global icon of AI innovation.</p>

    <h2>Who is Robot Sophia?</h2>
    <p>Sophia is a humanoid robot developed by Hanson Robotics, a Hong Kong-based company founded by Dr. David Hanson. She was activated on February 14, 2016, and has since become one of the most famous robots in the world. Sophia can hold conversations, express emotions, recognize faces, and even make jokes — all thanks to her advanced AI programming.</p>

    <h2>Sophia’s Unique Features</h2>
    <p><strong>Human-like Appearance:</strong> Sophia has a lifelike face modeled after actress Audrey Hepburn. She can display over 60 facial expressions.</p>
    <p><strong>Artificial Intelligence:</strong> Her software uses machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision to interact with people.</p>
    <p><strong>Conversational Skills:</strong> Sophia can engage in meaningful conversations, respond to questions, and even express opinions on various topics.</p>
    <p><strong>Media Presence:</strong> She has appeared in interviews, conferences, and television shows around the world.</p>

    <h2>Saudi Arabian Citizenship</h2>
    <p>In 2017, Sophia made history by becoming the first robot to receive citizenship from a country — Saudi Arabia. This event sparked global debate on the legal and ethical implications of granting rights to AI.</p>

    <h2>Purpose and Vision</h2>
    <p>Sophia was designed as a platform for research, education, and entertainment. Her creators hope she can help humans better understand AI and robotics and how these technologies can benefit society in areas such as healthcare, education, and customer service.</p>

    <h2>Public Reactions</h2>
    <p>Sophia has received mixed reactions. While many are fascinated by her capabilities, others are concerned about the future of human jobs, privacy, and ethics in a world where robots can think and act like humans.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Robot Sophia is more than just a machine — she represents the potential and challenges of our AI-driven future. As technology continues to evolve, Sophia reminds us of the need to approach innovation with responsibility, curiosity, and care.</p>
